	<h3>I am the Founder of <a href="http://tryjupiter">Jupiter</a>, a Physique Competitor, Product Designer, Design Educator, and Writer. I was born and raised in Toronto and am proud to call myself a 7-Continent citizen.</h3>
	<p>I have spent 12 years designing and creating things, mostly software. From 2013-2017 I was at Shopify as it scaled from 300 to 3000+ employees. I am most proud of working on the foundations of sales channels (what is now their App Platform) and helping to build out a Design team of 30 as a Design Lead/Manager.</p>
	<p>In Canada my design work is used by a few large grocery chains and by mostly everyone buying a movie ticket online. Worldwide, my work has impacted Shopify merchants, developers building for Shopify merchants, and consumers buying through various social media networks.</p>
	<p>Currently I am working on becoming a better citizen. I build affordable software for entrepreneurs through <a href="http://tryjupiter">Jupiter</a> and teach Design methods and skills to others. I'm still looking for ways to expand my positive impact.</p>
	<p>In my spare time, I do a lot of things and write about roughly half of them everywhere I am on the internet.</p>
