	<h3>I am the Founder of <a href="http://tryjupiter.com">Jupiter</a>, a Physique Competitor, Product Designer, and Design Educator. I was born and raised in Toronto and am proud to call myself a 7-Continent citizen.</h3>

	<div class="bio__body">
		<p>I have spent 12 years designing and creating things, mostly software. From 2013-2017 I was at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a> as it scaled from 300 to 3000+ employees. I am most proud of working on the foundations of sales channels (now their App Platform) and helping to build out a Product Design team of 30 as a Design Lead.</p>
		<p>In Canada my design work is used by a few large grocery chains and by mostly everyone buying a movie ticket online. Worldwide, my work has impacted 500,000+ merchants, the developers building for them, and consumers buying through various social media networks.</p>
		<p>Currently I am building a company which creates software for beauty professionals at <a href="http://tryjupiter.com">Jupiter</a> and teach Design methods and skills to others.</p>
		<p>In my spare time I do a lot of other things and write about roughly half of them on the internet.</p>
