title: Hard Lessons Follow the Rule of Three

Easy lessons are ones which have immediate feedback: touching a hot stove, what foods your body is allergic to, or even how to ask for a raise at work. Everyone can put together the cause and consequences of getting them right or wrong.

The hard lessons are ones which take months to _finish._ They require multiple factors to set up the environment, many people to be involved, and months to see the outcome of. I have found this to be true in both my personal and professional life: hard lessons follow the rule of three. They come to you three times and you only truly know if you've learned the lesson the third time.

The first time the lesson is encountered every day is like every other day. There is nothing new here because I don't know what I don't know. When the final consequence arrives, it stings a lot. I am surprised. I am outraged. I am disappointed. If I am at my best, I have had enough time to outline the situation and think to myself, "I will never do this again."

The second time the lesson appears, I've learned enough to identity _this is the second time this has happened to me._ I can draw paralells to the first situation and the current. I am filled with equal amount doubt (is this really happening again) and hope (I can do better this time) which prevents me from walking away.

The third time the lesson appears, it almost always occurs in perfect conditions. I have learned from occurrence one and two that there are common factors which caused the problem. I think, erroneously, perhaps, that if those conditions exist again it will never work out. The third time: they don't exist.

This is when I've learned the lesson. When I walk away, even from the perfect conditions, because the situation won't work for me for whatever reason. I will no longer seek the reason and the peace of mind from simply walking away is more valuable than trying again.
