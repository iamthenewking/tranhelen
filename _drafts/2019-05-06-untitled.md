excerpt: A few years ago I was deep in the midst of a long walk through an area north of the Arctic circle. In the evenings I would read before falling asleep. I'd like to share this passage about a dream Rosanne...

I am running to/from three separate worlds: the world designed by white men in suits, tech hustlers who scream 'hustle' in-between programming breaks, and tech balance-hustlers who scream 'balance' on Twitter.

My current topic of the week is _strategic intent_. This is the summary from a case study I'm currently processing:

> Western companies trim ambitions to match resources. Japanese companies leverage resources to accelerate the pace of organizational learning to attain seemingly impossible goals.

When they phrase it like that, it sounds _bad_ to be a "western company," right? Teach me the stories of Japan, _Harvest Business Review_.

## Competing Viewpoints

After reading <span class="cite">"Strategic Intent,"<a href="#note-1" name="back-1">*</a></span>, I am noting that HBR wants me to:

- Stop focusing on competitors; it is the past to predict the future
- Emphasize organizational learning
- Create corporate challenges with a sense of urgency
- Spread competitive intelligence
- Establish clear milestones and review mechanisms

This is unfamiliar territory because my own experience with hustle-life can be summarized to a list of values like so:

- Be faster than your competitors
- Every person is their own coach, mentor, and university
- Every day is a corporate challenge in emergency
- Knowing nothing about anything is an advantage
- Winning is the only milestone, often with money

And these two data-sets are compared against another, also unfamiliar, data-set in recent tech buzz:

- Lifestyle businesses need not be concerned with competitors
- Support people learning at their own pace
- Software takes however long it takes
- Knowing hustle is wrong is the advantage
- Success is defined differently to different people

Somewhere in here I have to find the rules of my own playbook and it gets a little hairy if you think about it too long.
