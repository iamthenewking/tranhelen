I've been in the midst of shedding an identity. It has never felt more urgent to do so more than now. There's many things to say about how hard it is to start a new avenue in life but the most difficult thing has been dealing with my identity.

_Designer_ was my identity for the better part of a decade. People paid me to do this for years and so I acted the part. When I decided to branch out and build a new product, I wondered how my decade in "solitary design confinement" was affecting my decision-making.

Mindsets have been a topic of interest for me for quite some time now. The past year and a half has been a long experiment in changing my mindset about bodybuilding. Going through the motions there have rendered a lot of unanswered questions for my professional career.

When I first started lifting, I wanted to _be healthier_, whatever that meant. I did end up becoming _healthier_ but that didn't feel as satisfying as I thought it would. As I started poking around, I noticed there was a very defined line between _athlete_ and _lifter_.

Two people with the same timeframe and one has hands-down the better physique. The results are in front of you on their bodies, that's how obvious it is. They do the same things, don't they? Do they eat the same? Does one train more, harder, or longer? 

After analyzing my new friends I realized that while some of those things were correlated to success, it wasn't always a clear line. What defined an _athlete_ from a conventional lifter was what they said when I asked them who they were: _a bodybuilder_. Their identity governed they did.

Everything else in the sport is an _inevitability_ because their identity already defined a certain set of habits. Those habits compounded over time inevitably lead them to success. Input equals output. It's simple, really.

Bodybuilding is an additive art: you start with a basic shape, pick where you want the clay, and place it there with training and diet. Shedding an identity, on the other hand, is a subtractive art. You start with a ball of clay and you chisel away until something works.

Since I'm switching gears to build a product I need to adjust my mindset. Part of it is letting go of something that I held so dearly for many years. This has been harder than I thought it would be.

As I go deep into it, I'm starting to realize the implications of being a Designer for many years. I'm not letting all of it go, of course, but I do have to soften parts of it.
