excerpt: Creating things on the internet feels both freeing and constrained. The tools I use are made by others and this seems misaligned with expression of oneself. I have a long-simmering...

After leaving my last position I had spent some time living off a schedule and had become accustomed to a leaky bucket of time. The only thing I had on my mind was to keep training and doing whatever work for Jupiter but then I added school. Jupiter. Training. Teaching. Schoool. _Yikes._

I created myself a productivity training program based on the tenets of [progressive overload](http://helentran.com/notetakingandaccountability). It's been working so I hope this is helpful for you.

## The Constraints

I use RescueTime* religiously and it had to be adjusted before I started focusing on productivity. The baked-in assumption of the tool's design: everyone wants to be measured on productivity so it tracks _all_ your time and asks you to set up boundaried work hours as a sort of peace offering. Then it delivers a score.

Not a fan of this for a few reasons:

1. Computers are multi-purposes devices. Sometimes I want to work on Saturdays and trade-in for Thursdays. Setting up boundaried work hours means either manually inputting or manually deleting. Time wasted.

2. Measuring time you're not working (i.e. enjoying your life) is unnecessary information. Random information is just noise.

3. The productivity score fosters feelings of guilt which is mentally unhealthy. If you can help it, guilt shouldn't originate from your own negative thought processes.

For a few months last year I let RescueTime run all the time and track every activity on my computer. I then manually went through all the activities and asked RescueTime to ignore everything which wasn't work related. I don't use it on my phone.

After a few months I had a tracker which only tracks work time.

## The Progressive Overload

My program consists of four-week long 'levels' which are measured in weekly sprints. I make a weekly goal and consistently have to meet it for four straight weeks before adding another level of difficulty.

This process allows me to build on strong habits without overwhelming myself. This also happens to be the reason why most people fail at their fitness and nutritional goals: they try to change their lives overnight based on weak foundations. The goal here is sustainability.

My on-monitor computer sticky note looks like this:

<table class="stats">

    <td><strong>Productivity Goal</strong>
