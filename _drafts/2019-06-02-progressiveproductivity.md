Creating things on the internet feels both freeing and constrained. The tools I use are made by others and this seems misaligned with expression of oneself. I have a long-simmering question which has never been addressed.

> Why does it feel like I'm creating in a box?

<hr class="--small">

Last week I published [this post](http://helentran.com/trendsinbulletpoints) and this nonsense bounced around in my head for _five days_ prior to:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td>> It's just a journal. Post it.<br />
        But, it feels insignificant.<br />
        > Journal, though.<br />
        Should I write something more... important?<br />
        > You're not NPR.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

My publication-fear was deeply rooted in how I chose to display my writing. I have a buried desire to publish my more thoughtful work so I designed with that ideal in mind. The consequence of doing so made me to feel trapped and I, very effectively, throttled my own creativity.

## Little Boxes on the Hillside

Creating is very fragile. Everything you do and experience affects your output. Conscious or not, we're always looking at the frame which houses our work.

Take Instagram as an example. The square photo restriction felt like it had a lot to do with the devices at the time. As time went on, users became more _aware_ of the frame and creative output was altered specifically because of the unique crop.

Although more photographic ratios are allowed now, there remains a couple which aren't, and so we're still making concessions.

If you're a photographer who wants prints than we're talking about cropping an image twice for display–once for print, once for the 'gram. Or maybe you never print. Maybe you just do it for Instagram. That feels strange to me.

### Other Blogs Have This Issue

I've long desired to do something like this on my .com yet the further along I go, the less appropriate it feels. When I look at it in-context of Rands' website, it feels _right_ for a journal to have a link out like this. On my own .com: my frame doesn't allow for that sort of note-keeping.

Medium runs into this display problem, manifested in a different way, as their display forces amateur (or comedic) writers to deal with the perception of being either _too serious_ or _not serious enough_.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/posts/052519-burrito.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Medium article">

The top comments indicate some level of expectation which were evidentally never met and it's not clear why the expectation was held to begin with. Again, this isn't NPR. He's writing about a _burrito_.

Do you think this encourages _more_ burrito work or _less_?

### Feels Late to Compliment Tumblr

I had no idea what was going on in Tumblr anymore but had good memories of it. So, I rejoined to capture this screenshot of the Recommendations tab:

Tumblr isn't frame-free but it's the closest we have been in non-creator-originated-displays. The content simply exists. It doesn't look like it was filtered on its way out. In its chaos, it's more creative.

Let's move our minds outside of the digital world for a second. If we're going to understand anything about creation display, maybe a great place to go would be Paris.

## Water Lilies

</figure>

This is Musée de l'Orangerie. The musuem houses eight paintings from Claude Monet's famous Water Lilies collection, known as the Nymphéas. Paintings from this collection are on display all over the world but this particular exhibit is special: it was custom-made for the work.

Monet worked with the head architect of the Louvre, Camille Lefèvre, to create a place for these canvases: natural light, plain walls, and sparse interior decoration. The work informed the space.

This is what I think about when I see creative work on the internet. I think about this musuem because I sat in that room once for hours. I know how it _feels_ and internet creation is just a different feeling altogether.

Back to computers.

## Responsive Content Display

<figure>

</figure>

When Responsive Design was introduced, the idea was rooted in design serving its content<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">*</a></span> except I'm not sure if we've pulled it all the way through. The browser window is changing for the device but the way the information is inputted and what happens during the output is not.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/posts/052519-ducks2.jpg" alt="Explanation of responsive content display with ducks, part 2">
</figure>

Content is now filtered through something else: the designer of the software. It's a lot like how websites used to be way back when developers created the majority of things:

> Oh, it says it needs to be a 1:1 JPG. No... wait, 1:1 JPG under 10MB. Does this work? No... what about this?

<hr class="--small">

## The Filtration

The point of this is not to say we should never have constraints in software design but to highlight how a software designer (with another point of view) can change what a creator produces. The expression is filtered.

You could say that art is always a conversation between society and the creator–there's no way to produce without some sort of frame. But I think this is an apathetic approach to it: we can change how freeing or constraining interfaces can be.

This is a really long way to conclude that I need to redesign this journal into a real one at some point.
