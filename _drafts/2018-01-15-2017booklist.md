        <p>In 2018 I plan to be more selective with my books. You're still welcome to sift through the books I read in <a href="/46books">2015</a> and <a href="/booksfrom2016">2016</a>. I likely won't be posting another list for 2019.</p>

                <p><b>A More Beautiful Question by Warren Berger</b>
                <br>Every Designer loves to ask why and so do most writers. Beger tells stories about innovative businesses and processes and asks why, in an approachable and practical way. This book is thoughtful and worth anyone's time–especially as tech continues to question it's impact going forward.</p>

                <br>I've been interested in big data since the last selection and this book was my first foray into that topic. It's an easy (and funny) read about how big data can lead us to answers on our questions about human behaviour.</p>

                <br>If there's any book I would blindly recommend to anyone regardless of who they were and circumstance, it would likely be this one, which may also explain it's popularity.</p>
                <p><em>"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."</em></p>

                <p>Adam Grant writes interesting narratives about how to create and indentify 'original' ideas. A great read for any creative professional.</p>

                <p><b>Peak: How to Master Almost Anything by Anders Ericsson</b>
                <br>I've been a fan of deliberate practice for about two years. This concept, originally coined by Ericsson, has undoubtedly reshaped how I look at my life and career.</p>
                <p>This book is filled with practical tips on how to achieve and get better at anything you want to.</p>

                <p><b>The Course of Love by Alain De Botton</b>
                <br>A fictional story about a married couple weaved with the author's thoughts about love.</p>
                <p>It makes my collection because unlike most books about this topic, it focuses on the middle part of a relationship-which is really the hardest part. Many people yearn for a beautiful story of a relationship beginning but this book will make you reconsider.</p>

                <p>I do enjoy Arnold as an author though. I feel like his essays about bodybuilding as a sport are greatly inspiring for anyone looking to change their lifestyle.</p>

                <p>This book is a thorough description of a very determined man who has had an an incredible life in bodybuilding, acting, and politics.</p>

                <p><b>Chuck Klosterman X by Chuck Klosterman</b>
                <br>Klosterman has been one of my favourite essayists for a while: I've read all of his books.</p>
                <p>He mostly writes about music and sports which are two topics I know absolutely nothing about. I like to use him to understand a little more about both worlds.</p>
