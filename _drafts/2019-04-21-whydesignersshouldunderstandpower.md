title: Why Designers Should Understand Power
date: 2019-04-22
excerpt: I really love this whole idea of "if you build it, they will come," or that other similar phrase, "just build a good product." It's a fantasy though. It sounds nice but it doesn't ring true for most human relationships. How does someone know you exist unless you show up?

There's nothing more astounding to me than a Designer who doesn't care about their environment. It doesn't make any sense to me to be employed as a Designer and not care about cultural contextsâ€“human behaviour is shaped by their environments and it seems absurd to willfully ignore a large part of _why_ they act the way they do.
