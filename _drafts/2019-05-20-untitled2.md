I can do this, maybe

Self-advocacy has been top of mind for the past two weeks; something I've identified as a weakness. I am convinced it is essential to the success of my team for myself to figure this out and yet I feel trapped in the search for resolution.

I came across an artist recently, her name is Sophia Chang. You've probably heard of her but I've just discovered her work online:

She creates beautiful work but I was struck most by her boldness. These two lines from her bio,

> Internet presence is all what you make it, especialnly if you know how to market yourself. [...] Sophia is a true product of her environment finding everyday excellence quite comfortable.

> Sophia as the poised business beast that she truly is beyond hype.

It was stunning, really.

# On Self-Efficacy

The leadership course I'm taking has recently brought up the topic of self-efficacy. Another phrase for it is _self-control_ which is noted in Primal Leadership as _a key component of emotional intelligence_.

Albert Bandura, a psychologist working at Stanford University, defines self-efficacy as:

> a person's belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations or at specific tasks

which he believes is different from confidence,

> According to Bandura (1997), self-efficacy does differ from self-confidence, but only in so far as confidence is a nonspecific term that is used colloquially to refer to the strength of a person’s belief. Bandura (1997) argues that confidence does not specify what the certainty is about, whereas self-efficacy refers to a belief about a person’s specific capabilities and how they relate to their anticipation that they can produce specific outcomes.

So, self-efficacy means: "I understand and can confirm I am capable of something and thus believe it," while confidence is simply, "I believe."

Sophia's website represents exactly that.

# The Building of Confidence

I like to do a lot of things and I have a tendency to throw myself into them with a lot of gusto.

# On Evidence

Silence is my nirvana; always have been obsessed with it. I grew up in a quiet home and retreated inside of myself frequently.

My second most common escape was inside the pages of a book. In one year of learning how to read I had already read every book in my local library's adult fiction section and started moving onto denser ones. This habit never stopped–I go through 50-100 books a year now.

This, I'd imagine, had some lasting impacts on my ability to self-advocate. I may _know_ or _do_ a lot of things but I know or do them in silence. I try to make up for this through social media but I feel increasingly split open and exposed.

# Tyranny of Corporate Life

Many years ago I was sitting at a dinner with a number of peers. Most of them I highly respected and appreciated for putting time into me so it meant something to me to be in attendence.

During one of the toasts of the evening, someone had congratulated someone for their accomplishments. I had never had that before–yet, I had done exactly what they had done... three times over with the help of another person at that very table.

I'll admit it wasn't the most flattering of moments in my life. I felt defeated–how hard did I have to work to get any acnkowledgement? And why did it matter so much? I chided myself for being jealous of the acknowledgement.

A couple of years later I would sit and listen to my two-level-up manager sing praises about my manager for things _I did._ Things I conceptualized _and executed_ without their contribution in the slightest. They received a promotion. I cried. Then I quit.

# So what, really?

I still have to figure out how to do this all without losing my mind in the process.

How do I do this without betraying who I am?
Who do I appear both humble and compet
