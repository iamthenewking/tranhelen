This year is my last year of teaching Designers (for the foreseeable future) and so I'm writing this all down for anyone who is considering taking on the task of developing a designer from scratch.

Designers is a fun profession to teach because it's so complex. A great designer should have strong craft skills, an ability to think in systems, facilitation and team work skills, and have developed a set of principles from which they work. That last bit is ultimately what they will be hired for.

Before we continue: this is meant to be applied by a seasoned Designer to an inexperienced, or even new, Designer. Your mileage will vary based on _your_ (the teacher's) experience in both your craft and teaching and the amount of energy you have.




When teaching anyone, anything, here are the principles which I've developed through years of teaching and self-education:

1. Work on a base foundation of knowledge. Once that becomes second nature, continue forward. If the base falters at the next stage, _go back and repeat._

2. Explain the why, show the how, then ask the student to theorize on the link in-between. Test their theory with them and go over the results. Repeat your why, repeat the how.

3. Systems thinking comes with experience. Ignore it unless they show a special proclivity for it, it's not important. They will progress.

4. Assign projects where 80% is familiar and 20% is not. Don't tell them the answer but point them in the direction where they can get it.






Lastly: you'll know the student has learned from you when they think about what you _would_ say when you're not there. They no longer need you at this point, consider pointing them to someone else who can continue their learning.

The next person doesn't necessarily need to be better at you in a specific skill, they just need to be different so the designer can learn how principles inform action.
