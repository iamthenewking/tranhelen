There was something distinctly uncool about simply _participating_ to me when I was younger. Winning seemed better than losing which in turn seemed better than participating. At least there was a verdict, I thought. Things were clear: everyone knew where everyone stood.

All my personality sorter tests (strengthfinder, enneagram, myers-briggs) agree that my biggest strength is my ability to sit on thoughts longer than most. This is also my biggest weaknessâ€“I sit on thoughts longer than most. The issue with people like me is that we have a tendency to withdraw into where we find the most comfort: inside. We stop participating.

All good things are are built with participation though.

It's hard to participate. The amount of data is too large to sit with, and even in bite-sized chunks it speeds by too quickly. I say and do things I regret and then feel ashamed for participating. Even so, I still think there's a lesson to learn here about participation awards.

The connection we have online with each other tenuous at best. We want to all say exactly what's on our mind and then we feel like quitting the topic or behaviour will somehow fix it.

What about Dribbble UI designs? I hate it, so quit it.
What about conversations on Twitter? I hate it, so quit it.
