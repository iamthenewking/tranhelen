I am Gollum. Many days I'm  in a cave chasing something which could be a _figment of my imagination_ and I'm talking to myself. Some days I meet people along my journey, who are incidentally also chasing what could be a figment of their imagination, and then I retreat back into my cave. I'm sure there are other similarities but it is best for us to leave that thread there.

Everyone wants to talk about metrics, product-market-fit, advertising, exponential growth, but not many want to talk about what happens to you when you've started a business.

I'm starting to believe the whole reason behind why hustle culture exists is to avoid thinking about the elephant in the room: we can't predict the outcome. If I let my mind linger on it too long, it can spiral into something else and I can hear myself thinking about blocking it with work.

Except, I've been done that pathâ€“I've worked 80 hours a week before and it doesn't produce better outcomes.
