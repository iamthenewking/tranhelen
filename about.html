    <p>My last 12 years have been spent designing and creating things, mostly software. My longest stint was at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, as it scaled from 300 to 3000+ employees, on the foundations of their App Platform and their product design team in Toronto. I did this while teaching design on the side as a way to foster growth in my profession.</p>
    <p>In Canada, my work is used by a couple of large grocery chains and by mostly everyone buying a movie ticket online. Worldwide, it has impacted 500,000+ Shopify merchants, the developers building for them, and their customers buying through social media channels.</p>
    <p>These days I work at <a href="http://tryjupiter.com">Jupiter</a> building software for personal care professionals. I wrote about why I'm doing this <a href="http://helentran.com/whyjupiter">here</a>.</p>
    <p>My spare time is spent writing, thru-hiking long trails, studying, and competing in physique competitions. I live in Toronto with a lizard named Omelette.</p>
