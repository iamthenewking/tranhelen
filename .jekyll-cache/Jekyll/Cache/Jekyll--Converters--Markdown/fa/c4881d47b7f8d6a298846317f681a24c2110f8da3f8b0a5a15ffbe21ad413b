I"Ì<p>I am Gollum. Many days Iâ€™m in a cave chasing something which could be a <em>figment of my imagination</em> and Iâ€™m talking to myself. Some days I meet people along my journey, who are incidentally <em>also</em> chasing what could be a figment of their imagination, and then I retreat back into my cave. Iâ€™m sure there are other similarities but it is best for us to leave that thread there.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to talk about metrics, product-market-fit, advertising, exponential growth, but not many want to talk about what happens to you when youâ€™ve started a businessâ€¦ mentally.</p>

<p>My suspicion about hustle culture is that it exists to avoid thinking about the elephant in the room: we canâ€™t really predict the outcome. If I let my mind linger on it too long, I start to worry about the team, business, or product and then I hear myself attempting to block the thoughts with work.</p>

<p>Except, Iâ€™ve been down that path beforeâ€“Iâ€™ve worked 80+ hours a week and it doesnâ€™t produce better outcomes. It produces tired founders with sad personal lives. We decided we werenâ€™t going to become that.</p>

<p>â€¦ but I would be remiss if I didnâ€™t acknowledge how long this tunnel seems to be.</p>
