    <p>Albert Bandura's self-efficacy theory was covered <a href="http://helentran.com/confidenceisntenough">last week</a>. This week is an extension of that post and I'd advise reading it to frame this one a bit better.</p>
</div>

<p>One of our goals at Jupiter is to build a non-homogenous team. While performance itself is gender-neutral, Iâ€™ve sought out sources to explain How-We-Got-Here in order to deepen my understanding. One of the studies I read quite recently about differences in male and female CEOs<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">1</a></span> says this,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Differential treatment of boys and girls in traditional Western society regarding the ability to take risks in childhood play promotes less self-confidence and self-esteem for women in work contexts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Women are not socialized to take risks from a young age. This has cascading effects as they enter the workforceâ€¦ impacting how they ask for raises and promotions, how they advocate for themselves, and how they fit in.</p>

<p>This last part is of immediate concern. This industryâ€™s gender ratio is getting worse<span class="cite"><a href="#note-2" name="back-2">2</a></span> and senior talent is harder to recruit as experience needs rise.<span class="cite"><a href="#note-3" name="back-3">3</a></span> Retention is table stakes if I want to hit my 50/50 ratio goal.</p>

<p>Retention is too large a topic to cover right now so weâ€™re going to focus mostly on how someone feels in their position under the conditions they can control. Self-efficacy is a big part of that.</p>

<p>While thinking about this though, I thought: why am <em>I</em> still here?</p>

<h2 id="walk-like-a-girl">Walk Like a Girl</h2>

<p>My parents had a laissez-faire approach to life and me: whatever. So, I wasnâ€™t one of the many who were raised to avoid risks (or pushed to take them) until I left the confines of my house and started meeting everyone else. I was told I wasnâ€™t good at sports and I shouldnâ€™t bother.</p>

<p>I often think about this in conjunction with this commercial by P&amp;G,</p>

<p>Iâ€™m willing to bet this isnâ€™t unfamiliar to other women either.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<p>Life went a little haywire for me in my twenties and I started to hike because I didnâ€™t know what else to do with myself. After a year of day hiking through my own depression and attempting to make something of life, I found the Kungsleden trail in Sweden.</p>

<p>I was going to be around there for a conference and it seemed like it was destined that I walk it. Why else would it show up in Google? I didnâ€™t think I could do it but I prepared as best I could and off I went.</p>

<p>I walked my first 100km backpacking trip alone. It took me under a week. From the moment I cleared the mountain towards the final hut, I couldnâ€™t stop smiling. Iâ€™d never done anything so hard before and had never been so happy before in my life.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<p>Hiking made the difference.<br />
Backpacking made a bigger difference.<br />
Doing it alone made all the difference.</p>

<p>Somewhere on the trail I found something I had never thought was in me and it was further reinforced by amazement expressed by people I met along the way. From then on, I would hike even harder trails: in all conditions, at extreme heights, on all continents, and become relentless in my pursuit for self-challenge.</p>

<p>The hobby changed my career and helped frame hard work and effort in a way I understood. I wasnâ€™t connecting with Silicon Valley-esque ambition; I connected with my steps, one after another, and they walked me towards finish lines I never thought Iâ€™d reach.</p>

<p>As I did more, I craved more and eventually found bodybuilding. When I went out on stage for the first time I heard that voice again: <em>I canâ€™t do this</em>. I chased the fear again and am still chasing it now.</p>

<figure class="journal__image">

<p>I take my trail lessons with me with confidence growing every day. I know I have more to give. Starting a company doesnâ€™t seem like that big a deal now. <em>Iâ€™ve been nearly naked on-stage, for godâ€™s sake.</em></p>

<h2 id="hard-work-and-play">Hard Work and Play</h2>

<p>Everyone in tech is delivered the same hustle-porn story: work hard in this career and you will be rewarded. Not enough people talk about ways you can build self-efficacy and I offer this story up as another data point.<span class="cite"><a href="#note-4" name="back-4">4</a></span></p>

<p>Building confidence outside of work deepened my belief patterns: <em>I can do this</em>. This extended into my career and kept me going as I was building my self-efficacy. My hobbies built my fundamental goal-setting skills, my discipline, and my patience for delayed rewardsâ€¦ exactly as the researchers identified: through  play.</p>

<p>Live fully outside of your career. The energy will come back in spades.</p>
