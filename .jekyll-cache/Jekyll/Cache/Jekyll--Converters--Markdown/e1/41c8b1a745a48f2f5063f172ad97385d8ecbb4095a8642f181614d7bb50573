I"Ä<p>Diplaying created things on the internet feels both freeing and constrained. The tools I use are made by others and this seems misaligned with expression of oneself. I have a long-simmering question which has never been addressed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does it feel like Iâ€™m creating in a box?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="--small" />

<p>Last week I published <a href="http://helentran.com/trendsinbulletpoints">this post</a> and this nonsense bounced around in my head for <em>five days</em> prior to:</p>

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td>&gt; It's just a journal. Post it.<br />
        But, it feels insignificant.<br />
        &gt; Journal, though.<br />
        Should I write something more... important?<br />
        &gt; You're not NPR.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>My publication-fear was deeply rooted in how I chose to display my writing. I have a buried desire to publish my more thoughtful work so I designed with that ideal in mind. The consequence of doing so made me to feel trapped and I, very effectively, throttled my own creativity.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<h2 id="frames">Frames</h2>

<p>Creating is very fragile. Everything you do and experience affects your output. Conscious or not, weâ€™re always looking at the frame which houses our work.</p>

<p>Take a look at Instagram as an example. The square photo restriction felt like it had a lot to do with the devices at the time. As time went on, users became more <em>aware</em> of the frame and creative output was altered specifically because of the unique crop.</p>

<p>Although more photographic ratios are allowed now, there remains a couple which arenâ€™t, and so weâ€™re still making concessions.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re a photographer who wants prints than weâ€™re talking about cropping an image twice for displayâ€“once for print, once for the â€˜gram. Or maybe you never print. Maybe you just do it for â€˜gram. That feels strange to me.</p>

<p>Randsâ€™ blog has something like this: links out to other websites with a relevant quote. Iâ€™ve long desired to do something like this yet the further along I go, the less appropriate it feels. When I look at it in-context of his website, it feels <em>right</em> for a journal to have this. My frame doesnâ€™t allow for that sort of note-keeping though.</p>

<p>Medium runs into this content display problem, manifested in a different way, as their display forces amateur (or comedic) writers to deal with the perception of being either <em>too serious</em> or <em>not serious enough</em>. I have a theory it is because of the aesthetics: too much elevation changes the perception of the content.</p>

<p>The top comments indicate some level of expectation which were evidentally never met and itâ€™s not clear why the expectation was held to begin with. Again, this isnâ€™t NPR. Heâ€™s writing about a <em>burrito</em>.</p>

<p>Do you think this encourages <em>more</em> burrito work or <em>less</em>?</p>

<p>I had no idea what was going on in Tumblr anymore but had good memories of it. I rejoined to capture this screenshot of the Recommendations tab:</p>

<p>Tumblr isnâ€™t frame-free but itâ€™s the closest we have been in non-creator-originated-displays. The content doesnâ€™t look like it was filtered on its way out. In its chaos, it allows for more creativity.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s pause this line of thought and take a look at something in Paris.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<h2 id="water-lilies">Water Lilies</h2>

<p>Have you heard of the MusÃ©e de lâ€™Orangerie? The musuem houses eight paintings from Claude Monetâ€™s famous Water Lilies collection, known as the NymphÃ©as. Paintings from this collection are on display all over the world but this particular exhibit is special: it was custom-made for the work.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/posts/052519-monet.jpg" alt="Picture of Water Lillies collection in Paris" />
</figure>

<p>Monet worked with the head architect of the Louvre, Camille LefÃ¨vre, to create a place for these canvases: natural light, plain walls, and sparse interior decoration. The work informed the space.</p>

<p>This musuem is what I think about when I see creative work displayed on the internet. I want the internet to feel the same as this musuem but it doesnâ€™t. I canâ€™t stop  seeing the frames.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<h2 id="responsive-content-display">Responsive Content Display</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/posts/052519-ducks1.jpg" alt="Explanation of responsive content display with duck pictures" />
</figure>

<p>When Responsive Design was introduced, the idea was rooted in design serving its content<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">1</a></span> except Iâ€™m not sure if weâ€™ve pulled it all the way through. The browser window is changing for the device but the way the information is inputted and what happens during the output is not.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/posts/052519-ducks2.jpg" alt="Explanation of responsive content display with duck pictures, part 2" />
</figure>

<p>Content is now filtered through something else: the designer of the software. Itâ€™s a lot like how websites used to be way back when developers created the majority of things:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, it says it needs to be a 1:1 JPG. Noâ€¦ wait, 1:1 JPG under 10MB. Does this work? Noâ€¦ what about this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is now a collaboration.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<h2 id="the-filtration">The Filtration</h2>

<p>The point of this is not to say we should never have constraints in software design but to highlight how a software designer (with another point of view) can change what a creator produces.</p>

<p>You could say that art has always a conversation between society and the creatorâ€“thereâ€™s no way to produce without some sort of frame. But I think this is an apathetic approach to it: we can change how freeing or constraining interfaces can be.</p>

<p>Everyone should own their point of view without a forced collaboration. Weâ€™d get more out of it.</p>
