I":
<p>I had a few goals this year which revolved around arranging my schedule to align with my values. In order to see through this success I spent a lot of time offilne to give everything a solid college try. I’ve learned a lot. Specifically, I know intimately what it’s like to have your heart break one million times over.</p>

<p>Quite recently I stumbled upon this podcast episode which put into words some of my thoughts about this year (and the past recent years of my life) and have highlighted my favourite portions below:</p>

<strong>Rise of loneliness and loss of community</strong><br />
We are being over-stimulated and surrounding constantly by things which make us happy. This makes it easy for us to shut other people out which further drives us into loneliness. He theorizes this gives birth to ‘outrage culture’<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">1</a></span>, how calcified we have become to new ideas, and the more difficult it becomes, again, to not feel lonely.</li>

<strong>The Pursuit of Happyness and choosing the right director for it</strong><br />
“Americans can’t see what the American Dream actually is.”</li>

<strong>The illusion of logic</strong><br />
We think we all make logical decisions but the majority of our problems stem from our emotional issues. The ‘feeling brain’ is driving if you’re not self-aware that you can control your experience. If you can’t get yourself to work-out, it’s not that you don’t have the right plan: you have an emotional problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>My big take-away from this year: it’s okay to be heartbroken over all the minor and major disappointments of your life. It’s not okay to get stuck on them though. Leaving the rest to Dolly,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You better stop whining, pining<br />
Get your dreams in line<br />
And then just shine, design, refine<br />
Until they come true</p>
</blockquote>
