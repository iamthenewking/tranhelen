I"œ<p>I havenâ€™t been secret about this year being difficult for me: I placed a lot of emphasis on my goals and staying home instead of <a href="http://instagram.com/tranhelen">leaving</a>. It was a year of bedding patience: how long does it take to change the way you eat? the way you train? to build muscle? to fall in love? to build a community at home? abroad? to study for a university exam? an app? a company?</p>

<p>The answer to all of it: longer than you think and what you find hard is going to come easy while you struggle with things you <a href="http://helentran.com/theotherharderstuff">never</a> <a href="http://helentran.com/IAPandapple">accounted</a> <a href="http://helentran.com/onemillionheartbreaks">for</a>.</p>

<p>This coming year my intention is to focus on my main goals: build muscle and my company. The rest will fall where it will and I intent to simply observe and see what happens.</p>
