I"‹<p>I havenâ€™t been secret about this year being difficult for me: I placed a lot of emphasis on my goals and staying home. It was a year of bedding patience: how long does it take to change the way you eat? the way you train? to build muscle? to fall in love? to build a community at home? to study for a university exam? to build an app? a company? And while all that was being answered, my piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was to figure out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3RvdWXAzWR/">what is up with Texas</a>.</p>

<p>This all takes longer than you think (especially figuring out Texas) and what you find hard is going to come easy while you struggle with things you <a href="http://helentran.com/theotherharderstuff">never</a> <a href="http://helentran.com/IAPandapple">accounted</a> <a href="http://helentran.com/onemillionheartbreaks">for</a>.</p>

<p>This coming year my intention is to focus on my main goals: build my company and my physique. The rest will fall where it will and I intend to observe and see what happens. Iâ€™m feeling good about 2020 though: <strong>weâ€™re going to be profitable and Iâ€™m going to take home first</strong>.</p>
