I"Ê<p>A quote from screenwriter Eric Roth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For what it‚Äôs worth: it‚Äôs never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There‚Äôs no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you‚Äôre proud of. If you find that you‚Äôre not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time I started over was about five years ago. This decision intiated the biggest growth spurt of my life launching me in a trajectory I would have never dreamed of. I consider it to be my origin story of sorts and I‚Äôve often hoped to repeat the process again albeit in a less drmatic way.</p>

<p>Alicia Keys paraphrases a Stevie Wonder lyric, in the Netflix documentary <em>The Women‚Äôs List</em>, ‚ÄúSo make sure that you‚Äôre in it, but not of it.‚Äù</p>

<p>This quote for me has a lot to do with the common identity struggle a lot face. When I left my last position, I thought often about the story I was telling myself and how that story impacted how I viewed the world. I had come up with a slew of projects to keep myself entertained but found myself growing indifferent to them over time.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve since shifted gears and to help me move forward a lot of my .com has been removed. I‚Äôve been working on <a href="http://tryjupiter.com">Jupiter</a> since April and it‚Äôs not for Designers or anyone in tech. There‚Äôs a great sense of peace in this direction.</p>

<p>In it but not of it.</p>
