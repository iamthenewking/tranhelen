<p>Iâ€™ve had the wind knocked out of me twice in a month and am still gathering myself together. As a permissive move for myself, in avoidance of my publishing schedule, I have gathered past journals and resurfaced my learned lessons from the last four years.</p>

<p>2018 was never published so thatâ€™s your bonus. A filler episode with a bonus scene? Now, wouldnâ€™t love that?</p>
