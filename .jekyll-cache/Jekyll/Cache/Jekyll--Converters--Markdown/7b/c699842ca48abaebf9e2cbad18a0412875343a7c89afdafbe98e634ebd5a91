I"c	<p>The largest adjustment in the past two years to my schedule has been my morning routine. I don’t believe it’s a <em>direct</em> performance improvement although it has done a lot for my mental health which, in turn, is arguably good for performance. Every morning look like this:</p>

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td>
        <ol class="no-number"><strong>Training Days</strong>
            <br /><br /><li><strong>6:00AM - 7:00AM</strong></li>

            <li><strong>11:30AM - 11:00AM</strong></li>

<p>It’s nothing revolutionary. What I’ve found is this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Putting myself first in the day delivers the best ‘me’ to everyone else</strong> - I schedule activities which I need to do to be healthy, remain calm, and feel fulfilled <em>first</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Allowing my priorities to override and move on quickly</strong> - If the routine is disrupted, carry on with whatever is to be done and revert back. No need to over-analyze it or guilt-trip myself about not fulfilling an arbitrary idea of who I think I should be.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a long-winded way to say I used to think over-optimizing myself would lead to large gains. It did not. YMMV.</p>
