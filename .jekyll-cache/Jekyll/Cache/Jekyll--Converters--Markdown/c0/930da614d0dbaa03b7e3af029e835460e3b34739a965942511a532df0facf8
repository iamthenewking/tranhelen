    <p>This is a response to my own blog post I wrote <a href="http://helentran.com/thebalancingact">a few months ago.</a> As my understanding of balance expands over time, I want to continue writing about this topic as I am convinced it is key to optimal performance, in the gym or outside.</p>

<p>The benefit of immersing yourself in a new industry is the opportunity to learn the same lessons from another perspective. Everyone always seems to learn the same sort of things eventually, framed in a different way, and youâ€™re extra lucky if you find yourself being able to review life material twice.</p>

<p>Building a physique isnâ€™t easy, except that it is. People overcomplicate the wrong things and arenâ€™t focused on the right thing because the right thing is actually the hard thing. So, they invent for themselves a matrix of <em>seemingly hard things</em> to distract themselves from what they actually need to do.</p>

<p>In the physique world, it is very similar to tech: <em>if I work harder and increase my volume, I will be rewarded harder</em>. Your body doesnâ€™t agree.</p>

<p>In the podcast, Stronger by Science, episode 39, Greg Nuckols says this about lack of recovery in beginner trainees:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a situation like that where youâ€™ve had a week to recover from a training impulse and youâ€™re still having a pretty noticeable decrease in performance, I think itâ€™s very likely that the training you underwent was so extreme that you did actually break down more muscle protein than you synthesized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your body has an optimal point when itâ€™s getting enough volume and stimulation to grow. Anything past that point puts you at risk of under-recovery and cannibalizes your muscle. In the tech world, we call it burn-out. We push working past the point of optimal gain and when an employee burns out, they are so far gone they cannot function day-to-day, which effectively â€˜zeroâ€™s outâ€™ any previous gains they made to begin with.</p>

<p>Finding balance is the key to building a world-class physique but this work is hard. There is no formula for it despite what snake oil salesmen claim. Some bodies have higher recovery times (tends to be females, en masse), some bodies have never seen a day of exercise (tends to happen in sedentary computer folk), and some bodies donâ€™t respond to certain programs (genetic disposition in sports is still a thing).</p>

<p>Since there is no formula, many will claim all sorts of things to obtain that feeling of accomplishment. Eric Helms, another natural Bodybuilder and Educator says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Itâ€™s not a matter of willpower. Itâ€™s not a matter of hardcoreness. Itâ€™s a matter of: itâ€™s easy. Itâ€™s easy for you to go all-in. Thatâ€™s your personality. So just donâ€™t pretend that when you go all-in that itâ€™s because you have this incredible work ethic. Just be aware that youâ€™re actually taking the path of least resistence, not the path of optimality. [â€¦] But, if you want to get to your true potential, maybe you need to not do whatâ€™s easy to you, which looks hard and which you can post about being hard, but actually what takes a little more moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar to tech: many of us claim the hustle <em>needs to happen</em> or you wonâ€™t get results. This is a half truth. The level of hustling required doesnâ€™t need to be extreme because results will appear regardless of effort or timeframe. It is the natural law of commitment. To test this theory, I have been applying <em>non-hustle</em> to both bodybuilding and how I work at Jupiter. We have yet to see market traction with Jupiter but I do know this: Iâ€™m more content that Iâ€™ve ever been in any other tech job and this peace of mind is more important to me than ever before.</p>

<p>Sustainability has become king because I love building software enough to continue with it for the foreseeable future. It plays to my strengths and now that Iâ€™m closer to my customers, I feel the full breadth of being a designer once again. I get to watch them use our software and listen to them talk about their lives. When they tell me they donâ€™t like what weâ€™ve built, I love the process even more. Since I know this to be true, it is up to me to build the right environment to sustain this continuation.</p>

<p>Physique building is very similar except the failures and wins are much more obvious. If Iâ€™m applying theory correctly and optimally, the results of my work are in the mirror or in the eyes of others. This isnâ€™t the case with my technical career where the positive and ethical impact of my work can be unclear and hard to measure. Building in a non-physical realm can be very unfilling in that aspect. Still, the lessons are there if Iâ€™m paying attention. And I get to review the material twice.</p>
