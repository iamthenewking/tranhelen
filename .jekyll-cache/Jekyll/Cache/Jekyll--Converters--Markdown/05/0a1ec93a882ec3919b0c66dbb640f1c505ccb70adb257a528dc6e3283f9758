I"Ó<p>Iâ€™ve been forming links in an unstructured manner about the following trends. Until I can articulate them better, Iâ€™m putting a pin in the following thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is a lack-of-leadership crisis across all industries and across the world.</li>
  <li>Taste will become as valuable as creativity, as output becomes increasingly more homogenous.</li>
  <li>An overemphasis on technology means an underemphasis on spirituality which is creating a lot of anxiety, depression, and overall isolation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I occasionally think all this cynicism is from working in a largely toxic industry but my non-techy friends tell me stories of this happening outside too. I felt obligated to type that.</p>
