I"º<p>Things you never knew you didn‚Äôt want:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A hairbrush which tells you how dry your hair is</li>
  <li>A smart mirror which tells you your face has wrinkles</li>
  <li>A facial toning device which identifies which area of your face is sagging faster</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all real products which hit the floor at CES in 2017. In a <span class="cite">Verge article about beauty tech<a href="#note-1" name="back-1">1</a></span>, one of the writers says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶ all this thing does is give me data that produces more work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling someone their hair is dry ultimately never solves their problem but it certainly <em>creates one</em>. With the mental burden of more data, she‚Äôs going to have to figure out how to make that actionable, if it is at all.</p>

<hr class="--small" />

<p>In, ‚ÄòThe Most Important Thing‚Äô by Howard Marks he descibes <strong>first order thinking</strong>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶ simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Named aptly‚Äìit‚Äôs the first thought which comes to mind. If you have an old car, you must want to sell it. If you have a house, you must want to decorate it. Voila! Here‚Äôs a product‚Äìit‚Äôll give you a lot of data about car-selling and home decoration and now your life is better.</p>

<p>The assumption made: with all the data everyone will make the right decision. It‚Äôs a bit of a leap of faith and incredibly idealistic‚Äìthe user becomes a hair expert, a data analyst, a realtor, or simply someone with <em>a lot of time</em>. Your product will inspire them to make that leap.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm skeptical.</p>

<h2 id="past-the-data">Past the Data</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúIf I knew X, what happens after?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When information was scarce and every piece of information which came through was stronger than the emptiness around it, it made sense to grab more data. With the world‚Äôs knowledge base at our fingertips, this no longer brings value. We need curators (influencers) and analysts (recommendation engines)<span class="cite"><a href="#note-2" name="back-2">2</a></span> more than we need more data.</p>

<p>Quantity of information is not correlated with value. We should be collecting the data, synthesizing it into a way which makes sense for our users‚Äô contexts, and making it <em>easier</em> on them. This means: more efficient, less decisions, and overall, less management.</p>

<p>A decent hair stylist tells you your hair is dry and tells you how to fix it. A great hair stylist knows your hair is dry, fixes it for you, and sends you home with the right products to maintain it.</p>

<p>Tech stands to learn something from great hair stylists.</p>
