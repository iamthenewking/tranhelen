On March 1st, Rich and I celebrated the one year anniversary of incorporating Jupiter. Over the course of the year we have:

- Built a 50% feature complete product (aiming for Minimum Lovable Product, or what we refer to as MLP)
- Run a successful hiring campaign, leading us to two (awesome) developers
- Grown a list of ~1000 people waiting for launch, but for now, are beta testing with ~130 active users

I had all intentions going in to better document our journey along the way. However once in the hamster wheel it became difficult to understand which decisions were private and/or inconsequential.

It's been a year though and this moment is worthy of a check-in. It needs to be acknowledged.

## What I Remember Learning

### Hiring and Time

I leaned on a lot of what I learned at Shopify about hiring. We pooled candidates, reached out to heads of bootcamps and schools, promoted it on every (free) network we could, and spent four weeks going through every application we received.

Our results are as follows:
- ~400 total applicants
- ~30 applicants were interviewed
- Various skill levels from new to extremely experienced
- Hired three with two joining the team

We intend to keep much of the process the same next time except do it over an extended period of time (purely for exhaustion reasons). We made our first mistake here with hiring because we didn't fully understand how much it cost to onboard someone.

Every person added to a team will create more work, for sure, but it also subtracts time from whoever their direct manager is. In a start-up that time is very limited (especially of a CTO) and we made a bad call somewhere along the way... believing we had more time than we did.

### Peace of Mind

Both of us came in saying we didn't want to work "hustle hours." When you have a start-up and this value, it forces prioritization.

Over time I have realized my life works as an integrated mesh. A pull in one area pulled everything around it too. Things in my personal life had to shift to accommodate for deep work sessions and many days I'm strictly scheduled to make sure I get in my training, deep work, and self-care.

All that being said, I did notice that doing that for too long caused me to feel restricted. One week of easing up on a routine every few weeks gave me the mental break I needed to stay efficient and content.

Peace of mind means I can take my time to make better decisions. I can let data rest instead of reacting. As a result, I'm more confident, can move on better, and have room to analyze for lessons learned and outcomes after-the-fact.

This has been a habit I've been building over the years but Jupiter has reinforced it over time: peace of mind is everything–especially with a start-up.

### Most Things Don't Matter

Finding other things in my life I love has been sustaining. I often observe others (or even myself) losing the context of life–fixating or ruminating on the business or things which won't move the needle, because that's all you have.

I've been forcefully putting boundaries on myself for peace of mind, as mentioned, but also to ensure that I never lose context. The sun will continue to shine and my lizard needs bugs to eat. In the grand scheme of things, most decisions don't really matter and most decisions can be reversed. It's not worth giving yourself anxiety over every little thing.

The key is to make sure you knew it was a decision to begin with. No one has complete information but if you go in with eyes wide open, the consequences aren't ever that melodramatic.

We haven't made that many decisions I regret–just one in a year. I think that's a sign of us working well together but I also think that's a sign of us understanding why and when things don't really matter.

## Jupiter is a Breath of Fresh Air

I quit my last position at Shopify half an hour after I realized I wasn't happy–I had nothing lined up and spent months wondering if I should remain in tech and continue to make software. I read books, went on a long walk, wrote 80% of a product design book, and went to Antarctica.

I'm more than two years out from that time. I think you can always tell if something is really meant for you when you're ready to walk away. In retrospect I simply needed a challenge which suited my strengths–tech CEO it is for now.

I'm so grateful to be in this position and I hope the future years are as nourishing as this one has been.
