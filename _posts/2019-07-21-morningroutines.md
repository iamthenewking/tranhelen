The largest adjustment in the past two years to my schedule has been my morning routine. I don't believe it's a direct _performance_ although it has done a lot for my mental health which, in turn, is good for performance.  My mornings, every morning, look like this:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td>
        <ol class="no-number"><strong>Training Days</strong>
            <br><br><li><strong>6:00AM - 7:00AM</strong></li>
            <li><strong>7:00AM - 8:00AM</strong></li>
            <li><strong>8:00AM - 10:30AM</strong></li>
            <li><strong>11:30AM - 11:00AM</strong></li>
            <li><strong>11:00AM</strong></li>
        </ol>
    </td>
    <td>
        <ol class="no-number"><br>
            <br><li>Wake-up when the sun rises</li>

            <li>Eat breakfast #2</li>
            <li>Work day starts</li>
        </ol>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
<table class="stats">

        </ol>

    <td>

It's nothing revolutionary. What I've found is this:

- **Putting myself first in the day delivers the best 'me' to everyone else** - I schedule activities which I need to do to be healthy, remain calm, and feel fulfilled first. When I'm at my best, people get my best.
- **Allowing my priorities to override and move on quickly reduces guilt** - If the routine is disrupted by my priorities, it's fine. I carry on with whatever is to be done and revert back when I can. No need to re-process.

YMMV.
