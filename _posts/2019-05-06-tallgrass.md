My current topic of the week is _strategic intent_. This is the summary from a case study I'm currently processing:

> Western companies trim ambitions to match resources. Japanese companies leverage resources to accelerate the pace of organizational learning to attain seemingly impossible goals.

Teach me the stories of Japan, _Harvest Business Review_.

## Competing Viewpoints

After reading <span class="cite">"Strategic Intent,"<a href="#note-1" name="back-1">*</a></span>, I am noting HBR wants me to:

- Stop focusing on competitors
- Emphasize organizational learning
- Create corporate challenges with a sense of urgency
- Spread competitive intelligence
- Establish clear milestones and review mechanisms

This is unfamiliar territory because my own experience with hustle culture can be summarized to a list of values like so:

- Be faster than your competitors
- Every person is their own coach, mentor, and university
- Every day is a corporate challenge in emergency
- Knowing nothing about anything is an advantage
- Winning is the only milestone, often with money

These two data-sets run up against another set in recent tech buzz:

- Lifestyle businesses need not be concerned with competitors
- Support people learning at their own pace
- Software takes however long it takes
- Knowing hustle is wrong is the advantage
- Success is defined differently to different people

The general topics are: competitors, information sharing, and goal-setting. Somewhere in here I have to find the boundaries of my own playbook.

## Wading Through Tall Grass

There are so many stories of success and no one can say with certainty what is worth paying attention to. We identify common patterns and even then, research on leadership and business strategy is in its infancy.

We also can't use the past to predict the future because the future is born in everyone's blindspot. That's what the whole _disruption_ thing is about.

No one likes a centrist but I am guilty of being one.

### Competitors

We will never know what competitors will do nor who will become one. We can't be faster than people we can't see and to identify _what's missing_, you need to know _what's there_. Scale also buys power (and efficiency) so even in lifestyle businesses, it's worth taking a peek.

The centrist voice says, 

> Find out what others are doing so you don't fall into the same holes. Pay attention to anyone else who is also interested in the same holes.

### Information Sharing

Some people are intrinsically motivated if you've hired correctly. You won't make all the right hiring decisions though and you will end up with people you have to push. You also have information you need to spread around so they can do their jobs.

The centrist voice says,

> Intrisically motivated employees will find their own way. Encourage the other ones. Feed both enough information to do their jobs but not so much to leave them in states of arrest.

### Goal-Setting

Top-down management and leadership plans have been shown to occasionally thwart innovation through blind compliance. Also, setting a goal about revenue is obvious: _every_ company's goal is revenue. Value is not synonymous with money.

The centrist voice says,

> Teach goal-setting habits through example by setting valuable KPIs outside of revenue. If they (personally) define success in a different way, find the link between their goals and the organization's goals.

This past week I've refined my playbook to look something like this:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td><strong>You-Will-Likely-Be-Wrong-At-Some-Point Strategy</strong>
    <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Use competitors' to avoid common pitfalls</li>
            <li>Encourage organizational sharing</li>
            <li>Teach goal-setting habits</li>
        </ol>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

I think that just about covers it.
