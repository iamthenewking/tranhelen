twitter_desc: What I thought about as I landed on the seventh continent

All seven continents by 30, I wrote. I wanted to be the person that could say that. On December 16th 2017 I became that person I wanted to be and had some anxieties to contend withâ€“somewhere along the way to becoming that person the goal post had disappeared. 

As I watched the other seven continents citizens hold their celebratory sign on the Antarctic peninsula, I wondered what I had wanted all those years ago. I was curious. I wanted a world that wasn't available to me. I had somewhere learned that being well-travelled also meant having a well-lived life but I really had no idea what that meant.

During the last years of visiting the final continents I had been slowly giving up. I questioned why I was doing it and what I thought I'd find. Perhaps I had made a mistake... correlating distance travelled to depth of wisdom.

What I had originally thought I wanted this for had already happened. I wanted to be more mature, more compassionate, more calm. I had always been in love with getting older. I picked all these things up naturally and the lessons weren't found in physical locations.

It turns out it doesn't take that much to go to a place. Or many places, even. It turns out it meant much more to stay. To choose to not move. To choose to live the day-in and day-out of the mundane and believe every day that you should be exactly where you are, with whomever, doing exactly what you're doing. 

Does this mean that ambitious girl within will stop setting goals? Never. Perhaps it simply means that she's finally understood that a goal post is not the destination.
