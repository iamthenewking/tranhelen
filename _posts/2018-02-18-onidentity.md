A quote from screenwriter Eric Roth:

> For what it’s worth: it’s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of. If you find that you’re not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again.

The last time I started over was about five years ago. This decision intiated the biggest growth spurt of my life launching me in a trajectory I would have never dreamed of. I consider it to be my origin story of sorts but I've often hoped to repeat the process again at a later points albeit in a less drmatic way.

Alicia Keys says something in the Netflix documentary The Women's List as she paraphrases a Stevie Wonder lyric, "So make sure that you're in it, but not of it."

This quote for me has a lot to do with the common identity struggle a lot face. When I left my last position, I thought often about the story I was telling myself and how that story impacted how I viewed the world. I had come up with a slew of projects to keep myself entertained for some time but I realized I was becoming increasingly indifferent to them.

I've since shifted gears and to help me move forward a lot of my .com has been removed. I've been working on <a href="http://tryjupiter.com">Jupiter</a> since April and it's not for Designers or anyone in tech. I feel a great sense of peace in this direction.

In it but not of it.
