My lizard, Omelette, spends a good portion of her time sitting on a log basking under a heat lamp. During my midday break she continues to sit during our one-sided conversations where I carry most of the workload. I find this routine peaceful, often cathartic, and she seems to enjoy the worm or two she receives out of participating.

I've had a lot of pets over the years and I'm beginning to understand the peace of owning a lizard. They're not engineered by us to be anything except colourful. They're just lizards. All instinct.

I've been learning a lot about _inevitability_ lately. I spent the early portion of my 20s optimizing for minor percentile increases. The increases compounded and formed the foundation of my skillset but... at some point, the pushing stopped working.

Only recently I've been leaning off the gas pedal and I've learned that it doesn't really change my situation much. I still set goals. I still have evidence of marked improvement. I still achieve many of them. I'm goal orientedâ€“it's what I do. The _inevitability of me_ runs without management.

My coach said this to me during my last prep season, "you tend to get into your head." I repeat it a lot to myself now. It was his way of telling me, "Hey, everything's cool. Stop worrying." Sometimes you have to let time pass.

This entire time I was running with the thought, 'strengths make things easy,' but I think it goes deeper than that. Strengths are what happens if you don't _try_ to do anything. It takes some time to understand what that really means for you but you have to let time pass. It's all instinct.
