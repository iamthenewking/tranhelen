My bearded dragon, Omelette, spends a good portion of her time sitting on a log basking under a heat lamp. During my midday break she continues to sit during our one-sided conversations where I carry most of the workload. I find this routine peaceful, often cathartic, and she seems to enjoy the worm or two she receives out of participating.

There's peace in owning a lizard. They're not engineered by us to be anything except colourful. They're just lizards. All instinct.

I've been learning a lot about _inevitability_ lately. I spent the early portion of my 20s optimizing for minor percentile increases. The increases compounded and formed the foundation of my skillset but... at some point, the pushing stopped working.

Only recently I've been leaning off the gas pedal and it doesn't seem to change my situation much. Goals are set. Improvements are made. Goals are achieved. I'm goal orientedâ€“this is what I do by default. The _inevitability of me_ runs without management.

My coach said this to me during my last prep season, "you tend to get into your head." This runs like a broken record in my head now. It was his way of telling me, "Hey, everything's cool. Stop worrying." Sometimes you have to let time pass.

This entire time I thought, 'strengths make things easy,' but it goes deeper than that. Strengths are what happens if you don't _try_ to do anything. If you get out of your own way. It takes some time to understand what that really means for you but you have to let time pass. It's all instinct.
