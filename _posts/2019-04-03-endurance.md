Natasha Jen spoke at 99U Conference in 2017 about design thinking in her talk titled, <span class="cite">"Design Thinking is Bullshit,"<a href="#note-1" name="back-1">*</a></span> and I have thought on and off about this for quite some time. Her title and introduction buries her lead: real designers surround themselves with evidence.

We miss this a lot because we're stuck somewhere between the false dichotomy of design thinking vs. aesthetics. Somewhere in here lies the oft-forgotten roots of our trade.

Design has always been a craft; evidence must be collected with your hands. It is not an intellectual exercise nor is it purely production work. It's a _simplistic_ profession and complexity is found in the  endurance.

Endurance is required to break down an end goal into its smaller parts and test each part individually (whether it's aesthetics or not) until you find the greater sum. The core of time spent is in observing, iterating, and seeing it through it's execution.

It's hard because, frankly, it's not that exciting from an outside observer's point of view _which is why not everyone is a Designer_. Someone has to watch.

If your product is not in front of someone and evolving, aesthetically pleasing or not, you don't have any evidence. Without evidence, you're not doing very much. That lack of pragmatism is dangerous to a profession of crafters.

"Design Thinking" _is_ bullshit.  
However, "Aesthetics Matter" is _also_ bullshit.

Crafts require you to _do work_ and our craft, at the very least, _demands evidence of usage._
