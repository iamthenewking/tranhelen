I have been settling into a new life without a team or an employer for the past eight months. With this I've had to make a slew of decisions to align my activities to my priorities. This has been greatly beneficial for my mental health and overall happiness.

For the first month as I was working on this redesign, I tracked the time I spent digitally with RescueTime. I noticed there was a couple of things I didn't quite approve of: I was spending time on social media past the point of positive return and I felt overwhelmed on weekdays.

I used this project to test new habits: 5 hours a day, 6 days a week instead of 7 hours over 5. As I was already moving my work schedule, my gym schedule was moved to match it using my gym sessions as a prompt to start my work day immediately after. To curb any distractions, I set stricter rules around social time and time spent online.

This worked well but I still felt like there was too much on my plate. I continued this process and made some hard calls to projects I wanted to continue or finish, dropping them to prioritize my main project and my students. 

Giving myself this permission to be honest about the things I had on my plate greatly freed up head space for the things I did care about.

With this clarity I started to apply this thinking to micro-decisions about new project using first-item priorities to dictate how I use my time. Since I'm in the early stages of determining product market fit, I'm dropping the 10% in polish in exchange for the 90% I know will get me the results I'm looking for saving the polish for empty moments in between testing.

This month, I dropped down to 30 hours a week but I'm getting more done with less time. It likely won't continue like this once my project gains more momentum but for now I'm enjoying that I have enough time to stop and smell the flowers.
