After leaving my last position I had spent some time living off a schedule and had become accustomed to a leaky bucket of time. The only thing I had on my plate was to train, teach design, and build Jupiter but then I added school. _Yikes._

What came out of this was a productivity training program based on the tenets of [progressive overload](http://helentran.com/notetakingandaccountability). It's been working so I hope this is helpful for you to plug any leaky buckets you may have.

## Constraints

I had to adjust RescueTime<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">*</a></span> before I started. The baked-in assumption of the tool's design: everyone wants to be measured on productivity so it tracks all your time and asks you to set up boundaried work hours as a _sort-of_ solution to creating boundaries.

This is measured by a productivity score:

</figure>

Not a fan of this for a few reasons:

1. Tracking all your time means measuring time you're not working (i.e. enjoying your life). Non-actionable information is noise.

3. The productivity score fosters feelings of guilt and pressure which I consider mentally unhealthy and have theories on how it affects self-efficacy.<span class="cite"><a href="#note-2" name="back-2">**</a></span>

For a few months last year I let RescueTime run all the time and track every activity on my computer (didn't install it on my phone). After amassing enough data, I went through everything and asked RescueTime to ignore everything which wasn't work related.

After a few months I had a tracker which only tracked work hours. No noise, no guilt.

## Program

My program consists of four-week long 'levels' which are measured in weekly sprints. I make a weekly goal and consistently have to meet it for four straight weeks before adding another level of difficulty.

This process allows me to build on strong habits without overwhelming myself. This also happens to be the reason why most people fail at their fitness goals: they try to change their lives overnight. The goal here is sustainability.

My first on-monitor sticky note looked like this:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td><strong>Productivity Goal</strong>
    <br>
        <ol class="no-number">
        <li>[ x ] 25 hrs deep work</li>
        <li>[ ] 25 hrs deep work</li>
        <li>[ ] 25 hrs deep work</li>
        </ol>
    </td>
    <td><strong>Weeks</strong>
        <ol class="no-number">
        <li>[ x ][ x ][ x ][ x ]</li>
        <li>[ x ][ x ][ ][ ]</li>
        <li>[ ][ ][ ][ ]</li>
        </ol>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

When a week was done, I marked it off. After four weeks, the whole level was marked off. If I _didn't_ reach the weekly goal, I stayed at the same week until I did.

The initial goals were designed to be easy<span class="cite"><a href="#note-3" name="back-3">***</a></span> so I could get into a rhythm and routine. After the first three levels, I started to further refine what was considered _work_, prioritizing Jupiter.

New sticky note looked like this:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td><strong>Productivity Goal</strong>
    <br>
        <ol class="no-number">
        <li>25 hrs, sans Slack</li>
        <li>25 hrs, sans meetings</li>
        <li>25 hrs, sans studying</li>
        </ol>
    </td>
    <td><strong>Weeks</strong>
        <ol class="no-number">
        <li>[ ][ ][ ][ ]</li>
        <li>[ ][ ][ ][ ]</li>
        <li>[ ][ ][ ][ ]</li>
        </ol>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

In this phase I started asking RescueTime to ignore more things: Slack, any sort of meetings on Hangouts or Slack, and my studying.<span class="cite"><a href="#note-4" name="back-4">****</a></span>

Once that was completed I ramped up on time:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td><strong>Productivity Goal</strong>
    <br>
        <ol class="no-number">
        <li>30 hrs, deep work</li>
        <li>32 hrs, deep work</li>
        <li>32 hrs, deep work</li>
        <li>32 hrs, deep work</li>
        </ol>
    </td>
    <td><strong>Weeks</strong>
        <ol class="no-number">
        <li>[ x ][ x ][ x ][ x ]</li>
        <li>[ ][ ][ ][ ]</li>
        <li>[ ][ ][ ][ ]</li>
        <li>[ ][ ][ ][ ]</li>
        </ol>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

I'm in the last stages of this sticky note right now. I don't plan to extend the working hours although I do intend to further refine what work means. It can be difficult given how nebulous a founder's job role can be.

### Banking Days

Another thing I do is 'bank vacation days.' Being a founder means you may have to dig in on some days. I also have a habit of working eight to ten hours straight here and there. At the end of the month, if I work past my goal hours I decide if I want to 'bank it' to accrue holiday time.<span class="cite"><a href="#note-5" name="back-5">*****</a></span>

The reason why it's not an _automatic_ bank is also because I'm a founder. At the stage the company is in, I want to consistently be putting in hours. Some months I may decide to 'donate' my time to Jupiter. If I don't bank it at the end of the month, it's considered donated.

While I do leave the company some days, I haven't really taken time-off for quite awhile now. I don't plan to in the near futureâ€“this system leaves me pretty rested.

## Results

I'm the most productive _and_ calmest I've been in my career. I consider this of critical importance for my team: I handle a lot of the operations, marketing, and design. Allowing for founder burn-out would be reckless and irresponsible.

One day Jupiter will require me to break this to put in more hours and when that day comes, I won't be running on empty. Ready to go.
