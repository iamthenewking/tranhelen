I had a few goals this year which revolved around arranging my schedule to align with my values. In order to see through this success I spent a lot of time offilne to give everything a solid college try. I've learned a lot. Specifically, I know intimately what it's like to have your heart break one million times over.

Quite recently I stumbled upon this podcast episode which put into words some of my thoughts about this year (and the previous four years) and have highlighted  portions below:

## Highlights and notes

- `50:06`  
**Rise of loneliness and loss of community**  
We are being over-stimulated and surrounding constantly by things which make us happy. This makes it easy for us to shut other people out. Mark Manson theorizes this gave birth to "outrage culture".<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">1</a></span> We became calcified to welcoming new ideas and this makes us unlikely to create the relationships to get out of the loneliness.
- `58:35`  
**Happiness is found in self-confrontation and discomfort**  
We all need challenges: mental or physical. This aligns with my experience with <a href="http://helentran.com/hardworkandplay">resilience and self-efficacy.</a> "Life is not about getting rid of your problems, it's trying to get better problems."
- `68:15`  
**The Pursuit of Happyness and choosing the right director for it**  
"Americans can't see what the American Dream actually is." 
- `69:20`  
**The illusion of logic**  
We think we all make logical decisions but the majority of our problems stem from our emotional issues. The 'feeling brain' is driving if you're not self-aware that you can control your experience. If you can't get yourself to work-out, it's not that you don't have the right training plan: you have an emotional problem.
- `76:55`  
**"Discipline equals freedom."**

It's okay to be heartbroken over all the minor and major disappointments of your life. It's not okay to get stuck on them though. Leaving the rest to Dolly,

> You better stop whining, pining  
Get your dreams in line  
And then just shine, design, refine  
Until they come true
