Accountability is the hidden treasure of high performance. It's another bullet point in the long list of things bodybuilding has framed better for me. Hypertrophy requires _progressive overload_: to grow a muscle in size you must tax it. Every time. Non-negotiable.

This, of course, is easier said than done. You can agree to the rules but no one is really watching you when you're at the gym.

Many gym-goers will start their fitness journey by completely exhausting themselves getting trackers, new gear, and new clothes. It never occurs to them that some of the best athletes in this world mostly look like this at the gym. _He's barely wearing shorts._

The most effective technique isn't fancy and I'm about to reveal it here: write it down and beat it every week.

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td><strong>Week 1</strong></td>
    <td>50lb x 10 reps x 4 sets</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><strong>Week 2</strong></td>
    <td>50lb x 12 reps x 4 sets</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><strong>Week 3</strong></td>
    <td>55lb x 10 reps x 4 sets</td>
</tr>
</table>

If you don't write it down, you will justify putting in less effort because you're not in the mood. You will forget or you will even outright lie to yourself and say you did better than last time.

The brain is powerful and it's not really into exerting itself beyond its perceived boundaries.

This habit is now deeply secured in my work life and every project I start has three documents attached to it: 

1. <b>Brief;</b> clarify the objectives, what is expected to happen, how to measure success
2. <b>Notes;</b> detailed notes about the project
3. <b>Retrospective;</b> what was the outcome, what was learned, and how to improve next time

A lot of this has been particularly popular in the entrepreneurial and goal-setting circles. Some people call them decision journals, scientists call it the Scientific Process, the Navy Seals call them AAR (After Action Reviews), and self-help obsessives call them reflection journals or bullet journals.

It's simple. It's boring. It works.
