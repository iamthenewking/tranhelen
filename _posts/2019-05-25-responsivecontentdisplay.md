Creating things on the internet feels both freeing and limited. The tools I love are made by others and this seems misaligned with expression of oneself. I have a long-simmering feeling which has never been addressed.

> Why does it feel like I'm creating in a box?

<hr class="--small">

Last week I published [this post](http://helentran.com/trendsinbulletpoints) and this nonsense bounced around in my head for _five days_:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td>> It's just a journal. Post it.<br />
        But it feels insignificant.<br />
        > Journal, though.<br />
        Should I write something more... important?<br />
        > You're not NPR.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

My publication-fear was deeply rooted in how I chose to display my writing: I have a buried desire to publish my more thoughtful work. I designed with that ideal in mind.

The consequence of doing caused me to feel trapped and I, very effectively, throttled my own creativity. What other boxes am I creating in?

## Is Tumblr still, the best?

Creating is very fragile. Everything you do and experience affects your output. Conscious or not, we're always looking at the frame which houses our work.

Take Instagram as an example. The square photo restriction felt like it had a lot to do with the devices at the time. As time went on, users became more _aware_ of the frame and creative output was made specifically for the unique crop.

Even though more photographic ratios are allowed now, there remains a couple which aren't, and so we're still making concessions.

### Medium is a lot like this

I've long desired to be able to post a quote or link out from my .com. It feels _right_ for a journal to do this. Yet, I never have because my frame doesn't allow for that sort of blas√© note-keeping.

Medium runs into this, manifested in a different way, as their display forces amateur (or comedic) writers to deal with the perception of being either _too serious_ or _not serious enough_.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/posts/052519-burrito.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Medium article">

The top comments indicate some level of expectation which were evidentally ever met and it's not clear why the expectation was held to begin with. Again, this isn't NPR. He's writing about a _burrito_.

### Feels late to compliment Tumblr

No idea what's going on in Tumblr anymore, which may or may not be related to my age demographic which I reluctantly filled in during onboarding, but here is what I get now when I load the Recommendations tab:

Tumblr isn't frame-free but it's the closest we've ever been outside of websites without styling. The content simply exists. It feels like the inside of someone's brain and it doesn't look like it was filtered on its way out. It's _refreshing_.

## Responsive content display

When Responsive Design was introduced, the idea was rooted in design serving its content** and I still don't know if we really learned the lesson. It feels a lot like we've made the _frame_ responsive yet have continued to design constraints.

The size of the box in which images appear change but the box is still there. The box can be the device but most of the time it's the Designers' imposed constraints on the content.

<hr class="--small">

## Where is the exit?

I don't have a pep talk for this. The internet is still in its infancy and we're going to see our tools evolve very rapidly over the next few years. Until then, perhaps it's best for creative expression to happen outside the digital world.

... or maybe it should, even.
