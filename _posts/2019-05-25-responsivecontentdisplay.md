Creating things on the internet feels both freeing and limited. The tools I love are made by others and this seems misaligned with expression of oneself. I have a long-simmering feeling which has never been addressed.

Last week I published [this post](http://helentran.com/trendsinbulletpoints) and this nonsense bounced around in my head for _five days_:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td>> It's just a journal. Post it.<br />
        But it feels insignificant.<br />
        > Journal, though.<br />
        Should I write something more... important?<br />
        > You're not NPR.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

My publication-fear was deeply rooted in how I chose to display my writing: I have a buried desire to publish my more thoughtful work. I designed with that ideal in mind.

The consequence of doing caused me to feel trapped and I, very effectively, throttled my own creativity. What other boxes am I creating in?

Creating is very fragile. Everything you do and experience affects your output. Conscious or not, we're always looking at the frame which houses our work.
