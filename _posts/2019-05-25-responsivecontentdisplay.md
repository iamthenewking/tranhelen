excerpt: I've been forming links in an unstructured manner about the following trends. Until I can articulate them better, I'm putting a pin in the following thoughts...

Creating things on the internet feels both freeing and limited. The tools I love are made by others and this seems misaligned with expression of oneself. I have a long-simmering feeling which has never been addressed.

> Why does it feel like I'm creating in a box?

<hr class="--small">

Last week I published [this post](http://helentran.com/trendsinbulletpoints) and this nonsense bounced around in my head for _five days_ prior to:

<table class="stats">
<tr>
    <td>> It's just a journal. Post it.<br />
        But, it feels insignificant.<br />
        > Journal, though.<br />
        Should I write something more... important?<br />
        > You're not NPR.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

My publication-fear was deeply rooted in how I chose to display my writing. I have a buried desire to publish my more thoughtful work so I designed with that ideal in mind.

The consequence of doing caused me to feel trapped and I, very effectively, throttled my own creativity. What other boxes am I creating in?

<hr class="--small">

## Little Boxes on the Hillside

Creating is very fragile. Everything you do and experience affects your output. Conscious or not, we're always looking at the frame which houses our work.

Take Instagram as an example. The square photo restriction felt like it had a lot to do with the devices at the time. As time went on, users became more _aware_ of the frame and creative output was altered specifically because of the unique crop.

Although more photographic ratios are allowed now, there remains a couple which aren't, and so we're still making concessions.

### Medium is Like This

I've long desired to do something like this on my .com yet the further along I go, the less appropriate it feels. When I look at it in-context of Rands' website, it feels _right_ for a journal to do this. On my own .com: my frame doesn't allow for that sort of note-keeping.

Medium runs into this some display, manifested in a different way, as their display forces amateur (or comedic) writers to deal with the perception of being either _too serious_ or _not serious enough_.

<figure>
    <img src="/img/posts/052519-burrito.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a Medium article">

The top comments indicate some level of expectation which were evidentally ever met and it's not clear why the expectation was held to begin with. Again, this isn't NPR. He's writing about a _burrito_.

### Feels Late to Compliment Tumblr

I had no idea what was going on in Tumblr anymore but had good memories of it. So, I rejoined to capture this screenshot of the Recommendations tab:

Tumblr isn't frame-free but it's the closest we have been in designer-created software design. The content simply exists. It doesn't look like it was filtered on its way out. In its chaos, it's more creative.

## Water Lilies

This is Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris. The musuem houses eight paintings from Claude Monet's famous Water Lilies collection, known as the Nymphéas. Paintings from this collection are on display all over the world but this particular exhibit is special: it was custom-made.

Monet worked with the head architect of the Louvre, Camille Lefèvre, to create a place for these canvases: natural light, plain walls, and sparse interior decoration. The work informed the space.

This is often what I think about when I think about creative work on the internet. That, often, we have it backwards.

## Responsive Content Display

<figure>

When Responsive Design was introduced, the idea was rooted in design serving its content<span class="cite"><a href="#note-1" name="back-1">*</a></span> and I still don't know if we really learned the lesson. It feels a lot like we've made the _frame_ responsive yet have continued to design constraints.

The size of the box in which the outcome appears changes, but now it's occasionally filtered through something else: the Designers' imposed constraints.

<hr class="--small">

## The Filtration

The point of this is not to say we should never have constraints in creative work but to highlight how software design (someone else's point of view) changes what a creator produces. The expression is filtered.

You could say that art is always a conversation between society and the creator–there's no way to produce without some sort of _frame_ or _box_. But I think this is an apathetic approach to it: we can change how freeing or constraining interfaces can be.

I suppose at some point I should redesign this journal into a real one.
