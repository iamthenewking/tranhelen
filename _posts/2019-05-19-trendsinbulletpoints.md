I've been forming links in an unstructured manner about the following trends. Until I can articulate them better, I'm putting a pin in the following thoughts:

- There is a lack-of-leadership crisis across all industries and across the world.
- Taste will become as valuable as creativity, as output becomes increasingly more homogenous.
- An overemphasis on technology means an underemphasis on spirituality, which we sorely need now more than ever.

I occasionally think all this cynicism is from working in a largely toxic industry but my non-techy friends tell me stories of this happening outside too. I felt obligated to type that.
