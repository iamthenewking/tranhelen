I've been forming links in an unstructured manner about the following trends. Until I can articulate them better, I'm putting a pin in the following thoughts.

- There is a lack-of-leadership crisis across all industries and across the world.
- _Taste_ will become as valuable as creativity as output becomes increasingly more homogenous.
- We are undervaluing the power of the unquantifiable things in life.

I occasionally think all this cynicism is from working in a largely toxic industry but my non-techy friends tell me stories of this happening outside, too.
