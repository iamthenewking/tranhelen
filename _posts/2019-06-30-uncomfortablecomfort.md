It's hard to summarize what you've learned after you travel to seven continents and host hundreds of travellers in your own home. I've been asked, "what did you get out of all this?" and have had a hard time describing it until I read this from a book by by Christopher Hitchens which succinctly describes my biggest lesson,

> In one way, travelling has narrowed my mind. What I have discovered is something very ordinary and unexciting, which is that humans are the same everywhere and that the degree of variation between members of our species is very slight.

It's as accurate as can be: I find a comfort in the unexciting discovery... drawing from it a special compassion built over years of observation. We're all kind of the same. Like Hitchens, I believe it to be banal.

If you want to make it interesting, you have to learn how to identify and love the tiny differences.
