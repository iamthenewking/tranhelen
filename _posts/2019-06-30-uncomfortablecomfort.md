It's hard to sum up what you've learned when you travel to all seven continents and host hundreds of people in your home from all over the world. I found this quote in a book I've read recently by Christopher Hitchens which succinctly describes my biggest lesson,

> In one way, travelling has narrowed my mind. What I have discovered is something very ordinary and unexciting, which is that humans are the same everywhere and that the degree of variation between members of our species is very slight.

There's a comfort in this and I draw from it a special compassion built over years of observation.
